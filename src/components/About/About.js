      <p>
        I am a critical thinker with a technical background. My Mechanical
        Engineering background from Indian Institute of Technology allows me to
        think about problems thoroughly before coming up with an efficient
        solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently studying Information Technology at Humber College, I am trying
        to gather the tools I'll need for my career in Software Development, the
        most important one being the ability to understand new things rapidly.
      </p>
      <p>
        My primary objective is to pursue a challenging and successful career
        where I can effectively apply my knowledge & skills to contribute
        towards the development of my organization while improving myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like making music with my guitar and playing basketball in my free
        time.
